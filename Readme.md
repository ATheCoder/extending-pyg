This is my attempt at replicating the [Extending PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/extending.html) Tutorial.

My goal here is to understand the following:

1. When should I extend PyTorch using C++.
2. How should I extend PyTorch using C++.

These goals are instrumental goals for implementing a function that will generate k_hop subgraphs of a single graph as implemented in [Structure-Aware Transformer](https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/SAT).
